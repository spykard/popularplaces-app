Option 1: Pelias (Uses ElasticSearch) (Self-Hosted)

Option 2: Nominatim (Only usable with Text Query, Reverse Geocoder returns just 1 Result) (Already Hosted Online)

Option 3: Overpass and its online hosted version Overpass Turbo, both use Nominatim on their search Engine (Has very good Text Query) (https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/) (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Language_Guide or https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_turbo/Wizard) (https://boundingbox.klokantech.com/) (https://github.com/wiktorn/Overpass-API)

OpenStreetMaps does not support drawing on top of maps (https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/420/how-can-i-create-a-map-highlighting-a-relation-which-then-could-be-used-for-wikipedia-articles)
