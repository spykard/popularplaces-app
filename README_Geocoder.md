Option 1: Pelias (Uses ElasticSearch) (Self-Hosted)

Option 2: Nominatim (Only usable with Text Query, Reverse Geocoder returns just 1 Result) (Already Hosted Online)

Option 3: Overpass and its online hosted version Overpass Turbo, both use Nominatim on their search Engine (Has very good Text Query)
